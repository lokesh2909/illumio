# Illumio
First of all thanks a lot for taking time to review my application and proceeding with it. I am extremely sorry that I was not able to complete the challenge on time and took a bit long than excepted due to heavy coursework. 

## Code
I took nealy 600K entries as my input which is present in the data.csv file

Though this is not efficient code as I have implemented it using only basic if and else statements. I could have tried to implement a better solution given some time apart from the coursework. I have made the output to be written to a text file which can be seen as output.txt file.

I would suggest to delete the text file everytime before running the program as I am opening text file in append mode only

## Team
I am more interested in Platform team as it forms the base  layer for everything to work on.
Next I would love to work with Data team as it is the next important thing needed for the users.
Lastly I would love to work with the policy team which binds the data and platform and gets the things running in a orderly manner.
